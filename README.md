##### Description:
Do you use the command line a lot? Are you tired of spaces and/or capitalization 
in your files that you have to waste precious keystrokes to put quotes around or
hold the shift key?
NoSpace might be for you!

I built this script as my final project for Harvard's CS50P, Introduction to 
Programming With Python.
